## For usage
The instructions are divided in 4 sections and are meant for beginners, so if you have experience you might skip some steps.

### Section 1 - Making sure you have whats needed
The following steps can be done in any order but you have to make sure you do them all :
* Download XAMPP - https://www.apachefriends.org/es/download.html 
* Download this repsitory, make to have all files saved on one directory
* If you don't have it yet install Node.js - https://nodejs.org/es/
* Normally npm comes with Node.js but make sure you have it, you can run the following snippet on the terminal to check 
`npm -v`.

### Section 2 - Setting up Database
1. Open XAMPP and on the tab "Manage Servers" make sure MySQLDatabase's status says "Running", if says "Stopped"
 , just select it and click on Start on the right and wait for it to be running.
2. Then go back to the Welcome tab and click on "Go to Application".
3. A browser window will open up and you have to click on the "phpMyAdmin" option on the top right corner that will open phpMyAdmin dashboard.
4. Now you can create the database, to do so you can either click on "New" on the left column or click on the "data bases" tab in the top. 
IMPORTANT: make sure the name you use for the data base is    **delilah_db**
5. After creating the data base you can start creating the tables, for this step you have to go to the folder/directory called "sql" from the repository files where you will find the **delilahdb.sql** file.
In this file you will find all the SQL instructions to create the tables and relate the foreign keys.
6. Once you are finished you should see an structure like this on delilah database the "Designer" tab

 `npm install` .
8. Then initiate the server with  ` node server.js ` . 

### Section 4 - Testing (in Postman)

9. Up to this point you have already set up the API , you can now test it. For it you have to look for the file **delilah.postman_collection.json** and open it up.
10. A Postman will open up with the possible routes to execute the CRUD operations.
